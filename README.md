# Minecraft Texture Resizer

Minecraft Texture Resizer is a Java project for resizing textures from any resourcepack, that is made for Minecraftâ„¢.

## Usage

To use, navigate to 'Minecraft_Texture_Resizer/src/main/Main.java'. You may choose to change the size that will be used to resize to (reference the "size" variable's notation). The size will either be used as a literal size for every texture to be resized to (if useScale is false), or you can enable useScale to scale all images down by a factor of (16/size). You may also choose to enable or disable elements to resize, i.e. "blocks", "items", "gui", etc. to remove certain elements from the output resourcepack.

## Further usage information
This program is provided with a Javadoc in-line. Each element/variable that may be modified by the user has a corresponding piece of text for a description.
