# Minecraft Texture Resizer

Minecraft Texture Resizer is a Java project for resizing the textures of Minecraftâ„¢.

## Usage

To use, navigate to 'Minecraft_Texture_Resizer/src/main/Main.java'. Enter an integer between 1 and 32767 (inclusive) into the 'size' field. Choose which things you would like to resize, (i.e. 'block' or 'item'), and set those to true. Once you have chosen the types you would like to resize, run the program. The output will appear in 'Minecraft_Texture_Randomizer/src/out/', and you can move the folder named something like 'Resized Textures [&#39]x[&#39]' to 'resourcepacks' in your '.minecraft' folder.

Note: Some block textures have been removed from the block list, due to them being animated blocks. Animated blocks require a specific format, and have been removed due to this restriction. WARNING: Torches, ladders, vines, redstone, and other blocks that are mainly "see-through" may become invisible.
